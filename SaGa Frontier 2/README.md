### SF2 Combo Name Mod

Makes tech/spell names in combos combine like in Emerald Beyond or the Japanese versions of SF1 and SF2. The way they are combined can be edited in combo_names.txt. MelonLoader must be set up for the game beforehand, then just drop the .dll in the Mods folder and combo_names.txt in the root folder (where the game exe is).

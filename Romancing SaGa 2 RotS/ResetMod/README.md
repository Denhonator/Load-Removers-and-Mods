## Reset Mod

Allows resetting battle, resetting to title or to the last save, or aborting battle
Pressing "End Battle (experimental)" on a regular encounter likely crashes the game,
but it may work on scripted battles.
The option to retry battles is also somewhat experimental, but seems stable so far.
